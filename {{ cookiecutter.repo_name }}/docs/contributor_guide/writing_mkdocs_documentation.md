# Writing Documentation with MkDocs

## Introduction

This guide provides instructions on how to write and manage documentation using MkDocs.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have MkDocs installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

## Creating a New Documentation Site

To create a new MkDocs project, run the following command:

```bash
mkdocs new my-project
cd my-project
```

## Structure of MkDocs Project

An MkDocs project has the following structure:

```
my-project/
    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
```

## Writing Documentation

- All your markdown files should be placed in the `docs` directory.
- The `index.md` file serves as the homepage of your documentation.

## Configuration

The `mkdocs.yml` file is the configuration file for your MkDocs project. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
site_name: My Project
nav:
    - Home: index.md
    - About: about.md
theme: readthedocs
```

## Building the Documentation

To build the documentation, run:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This will create a `site` directory containing the static files for your documentation.

## Serving the Documentation Locally

To serve the documentation locally and view it in your browser, run:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local web server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Deploying the Documentation

You can deploy your documentation to GitHub Pages using the following command:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

## Conclusion

MkDocs is a simple and powerful tool for creating project documentation. Follow this guide to set up and manage your documentation effectively.
